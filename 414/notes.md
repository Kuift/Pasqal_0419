$$
\Omega(t)\ \text{controls how strongly the laser is driving the transition between } \lvert g \rangle \text{ and } \lvert r \rangle.
$$

$$
\text{Higher }\Omega(t) = \text{faster coherent oscillation between the ground and excited state.}
$$
$$ \text{oscillation speed follow this formula :} P_r(t) = \sin^{2}\!\bigl(\Omega t\bigr / 2) $$

Î´(t) make the rabi oscillation 
-slower in amplitude
-faster in phase accumulation 

driving hamiltonian matrix : 
$$
H(t) = \hbar \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \Omega(t)/2 \\
\Omega(t)/2 & \delta(t)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

With Pulser, you program the driving Hamiltonian by setting  
$$ \Omega(t) , \delta(t) , \phi(t) $$ 
all the while Pulser ensures that you respect the constraints of your chosen devices
