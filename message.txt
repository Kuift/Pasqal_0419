Here, for the Let’s Pulse 414 Challenge by Pasqal, register geometries shaped as a cat, a flower, 
and Pascal’s triangle were encoded and optimized using pulse-based techniques to approximate antiferromagnetic ground states. 
Pascal triangle configurations underwent both QAOA and QAA, revealing geometric frustration and emergent spin correlations. The optimizer did not manage to get a great state for QAOA 
Chaotic dynamics analysis of Rydberg-driven neutral-atom registers provided insight into sensitivity and phase transitions. Pulser Studio outputs supplied pulse sequences and visualization data. This code-driven exploration demonstrates how programmable neutral-atom arrays can simulate antiferromagnetism and complex many-body phenomena, mapping artistic geometry onto physical spin models
